This project contains several executable files written in Python 3

The primary algorithm is contained in the bowling.py file and can be tested by executing the test_bowling.py file
by using a terminal with access to python, navigating to the project folder and using the command "python test_bowling.py".

The project can similarly be run by navigating to the project folder and using the command "python bowling_algorithm.py"

This project makes use of the supplied API. This means that the bowling_algorithm.py file will not function without the API 
running in the specified location, but the test_bowling.py will still function.
